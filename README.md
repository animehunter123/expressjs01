# Description

Simple Node JS CRUD application with JSON storage (Express.js + Body-parser + CORS + Bootstrap)

Backend is server.js (express js server, with RESTful API endpoints)

Frontend is public/index.html (and also public/app.js)!

Data is stored in data.json, basically as soon as you click you will get data into the file

**<html><font color="red">The main goal of this app is to be a portable Node.js CRUD application with JSON storage, thus run it anywhere WITHOUT DOCKER relying on the NodeJS runtime... pretty cool!!!</font></html>**

**Usage:**

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `node server.js` to start the server
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

# TODO
